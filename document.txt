Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

Objective:
To configure firewall rules to block and allow specific traffic using Windows Defender Firewall.

Tools Used:
- Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- Command Prompt (for testing)

Steps Performed:

1. Open Firewall:
   - Press Win + R, type wf.msc and press Enter.
   - The Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security window opened.

2. View Existing Rules:
   - Clicked on "Inbound Rules" to see the current firewall rules.

3. Block Port 23 (Telnet):
   - Clicked on "New Rule" → Selected "Port" → Next.
   - Selected "TCP", entered port 23 → Next.
   - Chose "Block the connection" → Next.
   - Applied to Domain, Private, Public → Next.
   - Named the rule "Block Telnet Port 23" → Finish.

4. Test Block Rule:
   - Opened Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Enabled Telnet using: dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
   - Tried to connect: telnet localhost 23
   - Connection failed, which means the rule worked.

5. Allow Port 22 (SSH):
   - Clicked on "New Rule" → Selected "Port" → Next.
   - Selected "TCP", entered port 22 → Next.
   - Chose "Allow the connection" → Next.
   - Applied to Domain, Private, Public → Next.
   - Named the rule "Allow SSH Port 22" → Finish.

6. Remove Telnet Block Rule:
   - Found the "Block Telnet Port 23" rule in Inbound Rules.
   - Right-clicked and selected Delete.

Commands Used for Testing:
- dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
- telnet localhost 23

Summary:
Firewall filters traffic by allowing or blocking it based on rules. We created a rule to block Telnet (port 23), tested it, then allowed SSH (port 22), and finally removed the Telnet block to restore normal settings.
